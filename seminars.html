			Artem Dudko: On computability and computational complexity of Julia sets.<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will give an introduction to computability and computational
			complexity of sets with the focus on Julia sets of polynomials. For a polynomial p(z) its Julia
			set is the set of points on a complex plane near which the iterations of p(z) behave chaotically.
			Roughly speaking, a set is called computable if there is an algorithm which can produce an
			approximation of this set (by a finite set of pixels) with any given precision. Computational
			complexity measures how hard it is to produce such approximations. In the talk I will show that
			already in the class of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials there are various interesting computational phenomena, including:<br/>
			- large classes of functions having Julia sets of low (polynomial) computational complexity;<br/>
			- functions with non-computable Julia sets;<br/>
			- large classes of functions having Julia sets of arbitrarily high computational complexity.</li>

			John Harvey (Swansea University): Estimation of dimension<br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b>I will survey various established and new techniques to estimate the dimension of a submanifold of Euclidean
			space from a sampled point cloud, how we might investigate underlying assumptions
			of the estimators, and how they relate to testing for manifoldness</li>

			Pawel Dlotko (Dioscuri TDA, Warsaw): Mild introduction to TDA <br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will provide a general introduction to
			methods of TDA - concentrated mostly on persistent homology and mapper
			algorithm. I will present the basic theory, highlight the main
			application. But, I will mostly encourage questions and discussion.</li>

			<li id="04-11-2020">04/11/2020<br/>Niklas Hellmer (Dioscuri TDA, Warsaw): Nonembeddability of Persistence Diagrams with p>2 Wasserstein Metric. <br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> To apply kernel methods on persistence diagrams, they are
			mapped into a Hilbert space. The question is how much information we
			lose by doing so. I present <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13935">recent work by Alexander Wagner</a> that shows
			that persistence diagrams with p-Wasserstein metric do not admit a
			coarse embedding into a Hilbert space for p>2.</li>

			Austin Lawson (UNC Greensboro): Persistence Curves: A canonical framework for summarizing persistence diagrams</br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> As Topological Data Analysis (TDA) grows in popularity so too does the need
			for topological methods compatible with modern machine learning algorithms.
			The use of machine learning algorithms directly on the space of persistence diagrams is challenging.
			For that reason, transforming these diagrams in a way that is compatible with machine learning is an important topic currently researched in TDA.
			A promising avenue in this vein involves mapping a persistence diagram to a real-valued summary function or vector
			that maintains the topological information contained in the diagram. Inspired by persistent Betti numbers,
			we discover a canonical way to generate these mappings, which we call the Persistence Curve Framework.
			In this talk, we will (1) define the framework and show that subsumes several other recent summary functions including the persistence landscapes;
			(2) explore theoretical results including stability; (3) demonstrate some recent applications using the PC framework including texture analysis,
			time series classification, and skin lesion analysis; and finally (4) we will discuss the future of applications and theoretical development of the framework.</li>

			Rodrigo Azevedo Moreira de Silva: Proteins from Discrete Gauss-Bonnet Perspective  <br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			Proteins are fundamental blocks of life, and their amino-acid sequence
			and geometric structure define their functions. However, the intrinsic
			rules governing their structure are still largely unknown. The emerging
			field of Topological Data Analysis has been contributing to the
			understanding of protein-protein interaction, protein classification,
			and structure. We will show our recent advances in the application of
			Euler Characteristic and local curvature analysis applied to large
			proteins and their molecular dynamics, and the insight about the role of
			high dimensional simplicies for modeling such systems. The technical
			difficulties found in processing the big data required for the modeling,
			as well as perspectives of the application of the discrete formulation
			of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, will also be discussed. </li>

			Michael Grinfeld (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow): Topological Data Analysis techniques: unity in variety<br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> Given present-day vast computational resources, 21st century
			has seen a rapid development of techniques of topological data
			analysis. In addition to persistent homology, these techniques include
			Minkowski functionals and visibility graphs. I will review the
			Minkwoski functionals (and tensors) approach and the idea of a
			visibility graph, and will open for discussion two questions that
			seem to me to be central in this area: (a) which properties of the
			data are best captured by a which particular technique and (b) how are
			the different techniques connected, i.e. whether findings from one
			framework can be translated directly into results obtained by
			another. The thoughts on (a) and (b) will be very preliminary!</li>
